# SOLID principles
## 1. Single-responsibility principle
A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
## 2. Openâ€“closed principle
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
## 3. Liskov substitution principle
"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
## 4. Interface segregation principle
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
## 5. Dependency inversion principle
One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
